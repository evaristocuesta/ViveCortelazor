# History of the Cortelazor la Real National Open-Air Painting Contest
---

The **National Open-Air Painting Contest of [Cortelazor la Real](/en)** has been held every summer since 1999. It was an initiative led by **Blanca Candón González**, the town’s first female mayor, an honorary citizen of Cortelazor and a key figure in its cultural development, together with cultural promoter **José Pérez‑Guerra**, after whom the local museum is named. Both promoted a [**cultural initiative**](/en/what-to-do) that has become one of the most important open-air painting competitions in the province of Huelva.

## How the contest works

Each year, usually on the first Saturday of August, the town becomes a space for artistic creation in the open air. Dozens of artists from across Spain take to the streets, squares, and surrounding paths to paint their works throughout the day. In the afternoon, the artworks are publicly exhibited, and various prizes are awarded.

The contest is open to artists residing in Spain, and the artworks must be created on the same day in locations within the municipality or its natural surroundings. Since its first editions, it has seen high levels of participation, with dozens of artists from across the country taking part in each edition.

## Awards and organisation

After the passing of Blanca Candón in 2017, [**Cortelazor la Real**](/en) decided to honour her by dedicating the contest to her memory. Since then, the first prize of the contest, worth €2,000, bears the name **Blanca Candón González**, as does the town’s cultural hall. The full list of awards is as follows:

- First Prize "Blanca Candón González", €2,000.
- Second Prize "Margarita Salgado", sponsored by the Pérez-Guerra family.
- Third Prize, awarded by the Huelva Provincial Council.
- Popular Jury Prize.
- Local Prizes.

The contest is organised by the **Cortelazor la Real Town Council**, with support from organisations such as the **Huelva Provincial Council**, the **Huelva Museum**, the art magazine *El Punto de las Artes*, and the specialist publication *Infoenpunto*.

## The legacy of the contest

The winning works become part of the collection at the [**José Pérez‑Guerra Painting Museum**](/en/what-to-do), located in the village itself. The museum has grown thanks to the contest and now holds a significant pictorial archive representing the evolution of open-air painting in Andalusia.

This contest has made Cortelazor a [**cultural reference point**](/en/what-to-do) within the Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche. It not only enlivens the summer season, but also strengthens the artistic and cultural identity of the municipality.
