### Origins and Etymology

The earliest archaeological remains in the area date back to the 2nd millennium BC, with findings in places such as the Sierra del Cuchillar and the Cañada de los Domínguez. During the Roman era, a settlement was established near the present-day Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de la Coronada, where coins from the Emperor Augustus and other relics have been found.

The origin of the name [**Cortelazor**](/en) is uncertain. Some historians suggest that it derives from the "Court of King Azor," an Arab leader from the time of the Taifa kingdoms, while other theories link it to falconry, an activity practiced in the area.

### Incorporation into the Crown of Castile and Historical Evolution

After the Christian conquest by Alfonso X the Wise, [**Cortelazor**](/en) became part of the Crown of Castile, under the jurisdiction of Aracena. In 1631, Philip IV granted it the title of a town, allowing it administrative independence in exchange for a payment of 2,000 ducats.

The town faced ups and downs during the 17th century due to war conflicts and tax pressures. In 1713, the population had dwindled to 30 households, but by the late 18th century, it had reached 559 inhabitants, thanks to agriculture and livestock farming.

The 19th century was a period of growth, with a population reaching 910 inhabitants in 1887. The economy was based on livestock farming, cork production, and charcoal extraction.

### Transformations in the 20th Century

The 20th century brought significant emigration, especially after the Civil War and during the 1950s. Despite this, the town achieved notable advancements, such as the construction of the Civil Guard Barracks in 1923 and the new Town Hall in 1934. The arrival of electricity also marked a turning point in the lives of its inhabitants.

In recent decades, the economy has diversified with Iberian pig farming, construction, and rural tourism, with mushroom and chestnut harvesting standing out as complementary activities.
