### Who is Paco Flor?

Francisco Javier Flor Ávila, better known as **Paco Flor**, is an artist from Madroñera (Extremadura, Spain) whose life has gone through archaeology, athletics, and finally music. He was runner-up in the Spanish Long Jump Championship in the 1990s, but after leaving high competition he found his true calling in art.  

Since 2006, he has devoted himself to music, first as a backing singer and later as a songwriter and guitarist. He has performed in cities such as **Munich, London, and Milan**, and has shared the stage with artists such as **Asfalto, Eliseo Parra, and Marcos Bayón**.  

He currently lives between the **coast of Cádiz and Extremadura**, where he combines his artistic side with cultural projects. His music evokes great names such as **Javier Ruibal or Triana**, and is born from his life experiences and his connection with the landscapes of the South.
