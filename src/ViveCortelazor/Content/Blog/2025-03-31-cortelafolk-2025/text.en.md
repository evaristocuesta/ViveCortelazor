The **festival** is born from the joint effort of **neighbors, local institutions and businesses in the area**. The **schoolchildren** have conducted interesting research on the roots of **folk music** and the participating artists. Meanwhile, members of the **'La Palomera' Association** have created a spectacular handcrafted backdrop that will serve as the central decorative element on the stage located in the emblematic **Plaza del Olmo**.

Following the success of the inaugural edition, which featured outstanding performances by traditional groups and received an excellent response from the public, **Cortelafolk** aims to position itself as a reference event in the regional **folk music** scene. This year's program has been significantly expanded, offering a complete cultural experience with diverse activities for all audiences.
