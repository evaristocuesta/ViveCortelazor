## Crafts, Second-Hand Treasures, and Feline Solidarity

Next Saturday, June 14, a very special event is coming to Cortelazor: the **First Solidarity Market of Crafts and Second-Hand Goods**, an event that blends creativity, sustainability, and a commitment to our quietest companions… the cats!

All morning long, **Plaza del Olmo** will be filled with stalls offering unique items—handmade or lovingly repurposed—where you just might find that special piece you've been searching for. Plus, this solidarity market will help **support the sterilization and care of the village cats**, contributing to their well-being.
