**LUNES** brings stories and songs of life that you might hear in your own neighborhood. A graffitied wall, a street singer, and an old man who knows the life stories of the neighbors become the protagonists of this soulful artistic proposal that connects deeply with our shared humanity.

> “If the singer falls silent, life falls silent” — *Horacio Guarany*

With carefully crafted dramaturgy and sensitive musical direction, the performance invites us to pause and listen, to see the everyday with new eyes, and to be moved by tales and melodies that feel familiar, even if we've never lived them ourselves.
