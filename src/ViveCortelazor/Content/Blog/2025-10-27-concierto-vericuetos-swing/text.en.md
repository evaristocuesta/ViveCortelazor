## Saturday, November 1 · 7:00 PM · La Mano Verde · Cortelazor

**Admission: €10 / €8 for members / Free for minors**

The instrumental quintet **Vericuetos** arrives in **Cortelazor** with a proposal centered around **swing**, freely and originally blending elements of **jazz**, **gypsy jazz**, the **Morón flamenco touch**, and the sounds that emerged from **Seville’s Pata Negra** scene. Their music builds a bridge between **Django Reinhardt**, **Raimundo Amador**, **Diego del Gastor**, and their own compositions.

## A unique style: Andalusian swing

With **guitars**, **double bass**, **clarinet**, and **percussion**, Vericuetos creates a warm, recognizable sound that resonates with both jazz and flamenco lovers. Their upbeat, danceable rhythms have taken them to jazz festivals, guitar gatherings, world music events, and swing dance festivals.

The group achieves a balance between the classic and the contemporary: a repertoire that sounds both familiar and fresh, featuring original arrangements and lively improvisations.
