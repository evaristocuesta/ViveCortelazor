## A close and sophisticated musical experience

MAPA is more than just a music duo: it’s a statement of intent. Their motto —**Love, Beauty, and Freedom**— reflects the essence of songs that explore the world through a unique and poetic lens, with thoughtful lyrics and melodies that evoke emotional landscapes.
Their musical influences include **Jorge Drexler**, **Silvia Pérez Cruz**, **El Naán**, and **Fetén Fetén**.

Their live performances are intimate, elegant, and carefully crafted, transporting the audience to another universe and another time.

## Who are MAPA?

MAPA is made up of **Pablo Ramírez** and **María Luisa Rodríguez**, partners in life and now in music. After years of composing and singing privately, in 2023 they decided to share their songs publicly and began touring in venues such as:

* La Resistencia (Jaén)
* El Búho Real and Libertad 8 (Madrid)
* La Polivalente (Málaga)
* Café Teatro (Valladolid)
* Sofar Sounds (Seville and Málaga)
* The singer-songwriter showcase organized by the Andalusian Government at the Jaén Museum

María Luisa previously developed her musical career in the Christian music scene as part of the group **Mabelé**, and she combines her artistic path with her background as a **social educator and pedagogue**, bringing a special sensitivity to her lyrics.
Pablo is a **professional musician**, with a higher degree in guitar from the Seville Conservatory, as well as a **producer and arranger**. After 20 years of teaching, he now devotes his time to music production and helping other artists develop their projects.
