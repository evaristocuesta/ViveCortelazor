The festivities in honor of **San Juan Bautista**, patron saint of Cortelazor, represent one of the most special moments of the year in our village. From **June 20th to 22nd**, the streets are filled with music, tradition, and the community spirit that characterizes us.

## The Chopo Festival

### The Heart of Our Traditions

The **Chopo Festival** is undoubtedly the most emblematic event of these celebrations. This tradition of Celtic origin is celebrated coinciding with the summer solstice night, keeping alive a custom that connects us with our deepest roots.

### The Chopo Ritual

The festivity begins with a **community excursion** to the forests surrounding our village, where grows the protagonist of the celebration: the tallest poplar tree we can find. These majestic trees, which grow on the banks of rivers and streams, are carefully selected by the participants.

Once the perfect tree is chosen, **it is felled with an axe** following ancestral tradition. But here comes the most exciting part: **carrying the poplar on our shoulders** to the center of the village. This journey becomes a true mobile celebration, enlivened with music, dances, and the contagious joy of all participants.

The final destination of the poplar is the **church tower**, where it is placed as a symbol of renewal and celebration, thus marking the official beginning of the patron saint festivities.
