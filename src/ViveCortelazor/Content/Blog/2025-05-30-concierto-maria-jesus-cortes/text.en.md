## Music Teacher, Singer and Songwriter

**María Jesús Cortés Espejo** is a multifaceted artist: music teacher, singer, and songwriter, with deep training in flamenco singing and dance. Her artistic path has been shaped by major flamenco figures such as **Eva "La Yerbabuena"**, **Manuela Carrasco**, **Torombo**, **Patricia Guerrero**, **Farruquito**, and **Carmen Ledesma**. Vocally, she studied with renowned Cordoban soprano **Juana Castillo**.

She began her musical training at the age of 10 at the **Lucena Conservatory of Music (Córdoba)**. Her artistic curiosity led her to **Havana (Cuba)**, where in 2012 she studied contemporary dance and Cuban folklore (Afro-Cuban dances and songs) at the prestigious **ISA (Instituto Superior de Arte)**. There, she performed as a flamenco singer with the **Irene Rodríguez Company**, under the patronage of legendary ballerina **Alicia Alonso** — an experience that deeply influenced her path and inspired her debut album.

## *“A Cal y Canto”*: An Album with Soul

> “In the lyrics of this album, I wanted to express the different stages of my life, sharing a message of inner strength, acceptance of life, and a rebellious spirit against lifeless routines — in the pursuit of becoming freer every day.”

That’s how María Jesús defines her album **“A Cal y Canto”**, a title inspired by a well-known Andalusian saying that connects deeply with her roots.

This musical project was crafted slowly over seven years and blends influences from **flamenco**, **Cuban music**, and other **South American styles**. It features **seven original tracks** plus an **interlude**, with contributions from various artists and production by guitarist **Yannick Corre**.

## Music, Teaching and Roots

The **guitar** is her inseparable companion, both in her acoustic performances and in her educational work. In schools, it is a vital tool to connect with students through music.

For seven years, she coordinated the educational program **"Vivir y Sentir el Flamenco"** ("Live and Feel Flamenco") in several public schools. In 2020, her project **"El Cante y el Baile: Fuente de Conocimiento"** ("Singing and Dance: A Source of Knowledge") was awarded by the **Andalusian Regional Government** in the 6th Edition of the **Flamenco in the Classroom Awards**.

An artist with deep roots, broad vision, and a clear vocation to share art and knowledge through emotion and cultural identity. **María Jesús Cortés Espejo** takes her singing beyond the stage — turning it into a path, a lesson, and a way of life.
