In the small town of **Cortelazor**, nestled in the **Sierra de Aracena**, lies the heart of a community united by a common cause: **keeping their rural school alive**. The educational center, with **over 40 years of history**, now faces a challenge shared by many small towns: **declining birth rates** and a lack of new enrollments.

The **Town Hall** and the **teaching staff** have joined forces to reverse this situation.  
> *"The initiative emerged jointly, because although we’re not at the limit yet, there is a risk of closure if no new children enroll,"* explains **Ainoha González**, mayor of Cortelazor.

Currently, the school has just **two classrooms**: one for **Kindergarten and Primary with nine students**, and one for **Secondary with six students**.

## **Personalized Attention That Makes a Difference**

Beyond the numbers, this school offers something unique: **personalized and close attention** for both students and families.  
> *"Here, if a child has a difficulty, the teacher takes care of it. It’s almost like a private lesson,"* says **a mother from the school**.

The school is also equipped with **modern resources** like **3D printers**, **computers**, and **support teachers** that enhance the learning experience.

## **Innovative and Human-Centered Pedagogy**

The teaching quality is reflected in the approach of the staff.  
**Pablo González**, one of the teachers, highlights his passion for **Waldorf pedagogy**, which he applies daily in class:

> *"We work on math, language, and science in a very participative way, using games and activities that help students connect both hemispheres of the brain. For the children, it feels like play, but as a teacher, I know they’re doing very powerful things."*

## **A Village That Cares for Its Children**

Cortelazor offers a **peaceful and safe** lifestyle. It’s a **welcoming town** where everyone knows each other and children can roam freely. Families enjoy:

- **Free extracurricular activities**
- **Sports programs**
- **Swimming lessons in summer**
- And a community involved in the school through initiatives like **dialogic gatherings**

## **Attracting New Families**

**Ainoha González** points out that recently, **social rental housing** has been made available to help attract new families:

> *“We’re trying to collaborate with these families to adapt the school to new needs, like inclusive playgrounds. We're moving slowly because our financial resources are limited.”*

Also, **enrolling children in the school for at least two years** is the **highest scoring factor** when assigning these homes.

## **A Model of Community and Learning**

The school has recently become a **Learning Community**, a participative and open model where families also take part in the classroom.

> *"We’re trying to promote what we offer to reach people looking for a quieter lifestyle. This is a lively but very peaceful village, surrounded by nature. The freedom children have here is something they can’t find in a bigger town or a city,"* adds **Ainoha González**.

---

In short, the **Cortelazor school** is not just a place for learning.  
It’s a space where people **live**, **share**, and **build a future**.  
And now, more than ever, it needs to be **seen and supported**.
