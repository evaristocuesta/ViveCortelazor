## Saturday, September 13 · 7:00 pm · Museo Pérez Guerra · Cortelazor

The **José Pérez Guerra Museum in Cortelazor la Real** hosts the exhibition **"Paisajes pa ti"** (*Landscapes for You*), by artist **Manuel Hidalgo**, opening on **Saturday, September 13, 2025 at 7:00 pm**. The exhibition will be on view until **September 28**.

> “The landscape is perhaps the heart of the matter. Among all disciplines, it is undoubtedly the three-Michelin-star one. There is portraiture, illustration, still life, modeling, direct carving, fresco, encaustic, performance, video art and the entire creative universe you can imagine. And then there is landscape. If you ask anyone, they’ll say landscape is the earth’s surface, more or less touched by human hand—whether seascapes, mountains, or valleys. If you ask a painter, they’ll speak of nuances, light, composition, tones, iridescence, formats, this hour or the next. And if you ask an artist, you’ll enter another dimension, because landscape is territory, resonance, perception, disagreement, ethereal and elusive magnitudes, suffering, and the encounter with all the visual escapes of *plein air*.”  
> — From a text by Mario Marín

The exhibition is organized with the support of the **Cortelazor Town Council** and [**Galería Laecléctica**](https://www.instagram.com/laeclectica_galeria/).
