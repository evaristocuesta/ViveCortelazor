**RÂFUNKY** is the project of singer-songwriter **Rafa Naranjo (Rafunky)**, joined by percussionist **Chapi Roldán** and bassist **Álvaro Moscoso**, a young talent based in Seville. Together they form a powerful **power trio** that moves between **progressive rock** and **playful funky rhythms**, creating a unique sound they call **mestizarvaje**.

Since their first collaboration, Rafunky and Chapi have built a strong musical bond that resulted in the album **"Duelo Conmigo"**, along with new compositions that continue to grow their sonic universe.

An original, energetic and vibrant proposal you won’t want to miss.
