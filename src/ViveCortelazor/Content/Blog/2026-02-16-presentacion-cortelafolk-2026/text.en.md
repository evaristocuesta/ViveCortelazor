On **April 17, 18 and 19, 2026**, Cortelazor will once again be filled with music, gatherings and celebration. Spring in the Sierra de Huelva already has its must-attend event: the **third edition of Cortelafolk**.

This year the festival expands its program to Sunday, offering a full weekend to enjoy at an unhurried pace, letting the music flow through holm oak groves, squares and cobbled streets.

We are excited to share the stunning poster designed by **Jota**, member of *La Mano Verde. Arte y Naturaleza*, along with the artists who will bring this edition to life:

- Monstruo Laberinto  
- Ravecalé x Soleá Gatica

A rich mix of artists moving between roots music, fusion, sonic experimentation and the festive energy of DJs. Tradition and avant-garde meet in an intimate format where every concert is experienced just a few steps from the stage.

## Music in every corner of the village

Throughout the weekend, concerts will take place in different spots around Cortelazor, creating unique experiences in each setting. The entire village becomes a stage.

Alongside the music program, Cortelafolk keeps its open and family-friendly spirit with:

- 🎬 Film screenings  
- 🛠 Workshops  
- 🎲 Games  
- 🛍 Craft market  
- 🍲 Food stalls  

All with **free entry**, staying true to the festival’s philosophy: accessible, community-driven culture in close connection with nature.

## More than a festival

Cortelafolk is not a massive event — and it doesn’t aim to be. It’s small in size but huge in emotion. It’s about meeting friends in the square, discovering a new artist at sunset, dancing, and sharing food and conversation.

If you love roots music.  
If you enjoy small festivals where everything feels close and personal.  
If you’re dreaming of spring in the mountains…  

This is your place.
