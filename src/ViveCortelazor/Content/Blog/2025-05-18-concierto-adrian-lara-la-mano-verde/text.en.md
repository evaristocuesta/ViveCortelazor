The upcoming **Saturday, May 31 at 8:00 PM**, the Cultural Association **La Mano Verde** in Cortelazor will host a long-awaited musical reunion: the singer-songwriter **Adrián Lara** returns to the Callejón del Rosario stage, more than two years after his first performance in this magical corner of art and nature.

Adrián is a young musician from Seville whose life seems to be written between chords and landscapes. His path, deeply rooted in travel and exploration, has taken him across both physical and musical borders. From his early days playing bass at the age of 8, through his time in various rock-funk bands, and his journeys across Europe with a guitar since he was 17, Adrián has developed a musical identity rich in influence and emotion.

His songs draw from the **flamenco rumba** of his homeland, flow through the gentle rhythms of **bossa nova**, and are infused with the sounds of Paraguayan folklore, such as **guarania** and **polka**. His lyrics transform nature, travel, and everyday feelings into intimate stories that invite reflection and a return to the simple things.

It was during a creative period in Paraguay that Adrián recorded his album *Mis orillas* (2019), at the Music Zone studio in Villarrica. One of its standout tracks is "**Azucena**", a healing song accompanied by a beautiful music video recorded alongside musician Leandro Duarte.

Those who attended his first performance at La Mano Verde still recall the closeness of his voice, the warmth of his melodies, and the honesty in his message. This new event promises fresh songs, new stories, and the same sincere essence: a musical journey to what is deep and true.
