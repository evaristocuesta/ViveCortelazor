> “Mudanza, the action and effect of moving or relocating. The transfer of something from one place to another.  
> Mudanza sounds like beginning, joy, and change. Although it can sometimes mean loss and uprooting. But on this occasion, it is a medley of works that come together to begin something new.  
> Not everything that matters is here, but everything that is here matters.”  
> — From a text by Coronada Blanco Ortega

The exhibition is organized with the support of the **Cortelazor Town Council** and [**Galería Laecléctica**](https://www.instagram.com/laeclectica_galeria/).

## About the artist: María JL Hierro

**María JL Hierro** (Huelva, 1985) is a multidisciplinary conceptual artist whose work revolves around language, words, and everyday phrases. Her artistic proposal focuses on **tipoesía** (visual poetry), a form of expression that uses letters, color, and positioning to create works that are completed in the viewer’s mind.

Her creative process arises from reflecting on haste, change, and human relationships, using reading and words as both weapons and shields. Through minimal transformations and a direct visual language, she opens spaces for thought and questioning.

She has held solo exhibitions in **Huelva, Seville, and Cáceres**, and group exhibitions in the same cities as well as in **Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Berlin, and Tetouan**. She has participated in major art fairs such as **ARCO Madrid**, **Hybrid Art Festival**, and **Art&Breakfast Málaga**.  

Her most recent projects include the exhibition **"Los pasos perdidos"** (Fundación KOMUN.ES, Seville, 2023–2024) and her participation as both artist and curator of the Huelva Provincial Council stand at **ARCO Madrid 2024**.  

In addition, she has published several books and photobooks in collaboration with artists and writers, including *Lurra*, *Scars*, and *Bata rosa*, and is currently working on audiovisual projects such as the documentary **"Mujeres al fresco"**. She is also the founder and director of [**LAECLÉCTICA**](https://www.instagram.com/laeclectica_galeria/), a multidisciplinary art space in Huelva.
