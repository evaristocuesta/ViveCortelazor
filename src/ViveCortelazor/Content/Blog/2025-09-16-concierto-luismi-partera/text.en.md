### About Luismi Partera

After spending his childhood and teenage years in Cádiz, Luismi moved to Madrid in 2017 to pursue his artistic career, where he was enriched by a wide range of experiences and collaborations. His first studio album, **Sanjuán (2022)**, is a sonic journey of seven tracks that intertwine singer-songwriter intimacy with jazz and pop, featuring collaborations with artists such as **Pedro Pastor, María de la Flor, José María Cortina (Ketama), Nacho Mastretta, Álvaro Ayuso (Club del Río)** and **Marina Sorín**, among others.

He is currently presenting his new project, **Vendrás (2024)**, an elegy composed of two pieces dedicated to one of the most important people in his life. It is a song of love and mourning, born from a small town facing the ocean.

Luismi Partera’s influences are as broad as they are profound, ranging from the poetry of **Lorca** to the lyrics of **Silvio Rodríguez, Jorge Drexler, Pedro Guerra, Vetusta Morla, and El David Aguilar**, and from musical references such as **David Bowie, Wilco, Pink Floyd, Diego del Morao, Camarón, Juana la del Revuelo**, and **Rachmaninov**.

With his guitar and voice at the center, Luismi offers an honest and moving proposal, where the search for textures and harmonies becomes an experience for the audience.
