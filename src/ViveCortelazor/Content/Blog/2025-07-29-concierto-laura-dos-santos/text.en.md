## A voice with deep roots

Laura Dos Santos, an Argentinian artist with Andalusian roots, is a composer, musician, multi-instrumentalist, performer, producer, and arranger. Her work is born from a love of nature and a deep admiration for the great masters, expressed through ethnic and folk-based music from Latin America and Europe.

## A musical journey from childhood to ancestral sounds

Her latest album, *Cantos inesperados desde el cielo* (*Unexpected Songs from the Sky*), is a collection of songs dedicated to children, including stories, music inspired by natural settings, and suites that explore a variety of musical genres from around the world. An intimate and poetic project that connects with listeners of all ages.
