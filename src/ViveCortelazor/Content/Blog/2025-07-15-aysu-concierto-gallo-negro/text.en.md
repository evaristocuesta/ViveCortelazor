We welcome **AySu**, a gender-fluid artist and creator of a unique sound blending Turkish roots, flamenco fire, Afrobeat, dancehall, reggae, Afro house, hip-hop, and global rhythms. As a producer, singer, DJ, and live looper, AySu (formerly known as Sister I in the reggae scene) delivers a live show where she builds original songs **in real time**, layering loops, voice, and beats.  

Her show *AySu Live and Loopy* is an afro-diasporic journey full of global soul: Turkish and Arabic grooves, French bars, Brazilian beats, and flamenco essence—an energetic mix under the spell of the moon.  

Born in Australia, AySu studied Jazz at NMIT Melbourne. With Turkish heritage, she traveled to Istanbul to explore Turkish microtonal music and released her album “Over Okyanusya” (Over Oceania) and several singles, including “Nuri”, a jazz composition that made the top 50 in 2014.  

She has shared the stage with artists like Gotan Project and Björk, performing at major Australian festivals. Her style fuses jazz, soul, Motown, reggae, and Balkan, Turkish, and flamenco music.  

In 2019, she moved to Seville and launched her project “Ghazel”, fusing Turkish music with flamenco, jazz, soul, and electronic sounds. This led to the singles “The Calm” and “Istanbul”, for which she also wrote and directed the music videos.  

Since 2022, she has lived in Cádiz, a place she sees as a bridge between her two homelands. The sea has always been a major source of inspiration, evident in songs like “Sea & Destiny” and “Diyarlar”. In 2023, she founded her own label, **Earth Deep Sea Records**, releasing the Deep House single “Coming Apart”.  

As she says:  
> “Trust what gives you meaning and let it be your guide.”
