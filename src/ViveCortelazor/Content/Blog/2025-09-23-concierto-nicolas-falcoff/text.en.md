### About Nicolás Falcoff

Falcoff sings what he writes and creates a sound universe where acoustic and electric guitar, harmonica, and the **mbira** (a traditional African instrument) converge. In his solo format, he uses a looper to generate melodic and rhythmic textures that accompany his songs and interpretations of other Latin American composers. His music moves from **candombe to baguala**, with influences from rock and Argentine folklore, always imbued with strong poetic expression.

In addition to his role as a performer, Nicolás Falcoff is a record producer, radio host and producer specialized in world music, and a voting member of the **Transglobal World Music Chart**, a prestigious international world music ranking. He also holds a degree in Philosophy from the University of Buenos Aires.

For this concert, he will be joined by the **special participation of Aline (Riosentí)** and **readings by Débora Cerutti**.

Falcoff defines himself as a **“songmaker”**, seeking to convey experiences and emotions through a personal narrative, independent and deeply connected with the ancestral sounds of Latin America and Africa.
