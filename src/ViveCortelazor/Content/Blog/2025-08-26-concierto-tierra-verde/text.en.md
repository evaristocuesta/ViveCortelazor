### Tierra Verde: Songs with Soul
The project is led by **Francisca López** and **Gésùs**, two artists with distinct yet complementary backgrounds, united by their passion for sharing music in an intimate and close setting.

**Francisca López**, raised in the Catalan Pyrenees by a trumpeter father and a cupletista mother, has been teaching singing for over 30 years. With a clear and powerful voice, she has explored *Songs of the World*, performing with the duo Yardem and recreating Sephardic music and medieval romances alongside guitarist Paco Seco. She was also part of the band Flash Cero in Madrid in the 1990s. Her compositions include lullabies, pacifist songs, and touching pieces dedicated to the moon or to her grandmother.

**Gésùs**, meanwhile, studied Fine Arts but found his true path in composition. His songs reflect on family, friendship, and essential values of life, delving into themes such as loneliness, gender polarity, or the mystery of existence. He was the vocalist of the Huelva-based band *Sumergidos* in the 1980s, and his melodies sometimes resemble Gregorian chants, while others carry the intensity of operetta.

### A union rooted in the Sierra
Both live in the **Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche Natural Park**, where they have found a balance between their urban origins and rural vocation. Without great ambitions, they enjoy music as a gift to be shared with those who listen, cherishing the emotion of intimate audiences.

In **Cortelazor**, they will give their **eleventh performance**, saying farewell to summer under the coolness of the trees in the courtyard of La Mano Verde.
