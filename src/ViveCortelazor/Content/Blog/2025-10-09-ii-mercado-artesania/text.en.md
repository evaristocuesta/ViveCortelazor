## The Solidarity Craft and Second-Hand Market Returns

After the success of the first edition, the **Solidarity Craft and Second-Hand Market** returns to Cortelazor — an event that brings together creativity, sustainability, and feline solidarity.  

On **Sunday, October 12**, **Plaza del Olmo** will once again come to life with stalls featuring local crafts, recovered treasures, and unique handmade pieces. It’s the perfect opportunity to discover the talent of local artisans, give a second life to what others no longer use, and at the same time, support a very special cause.

This solidarity event aims to **support the sterilization and care of the village’s cats**, helping to improve their well-being and maintain balance within the local feline colony.
